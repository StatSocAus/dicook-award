      "contents": "\nStatistical software tools make a considerable difference to the\ndaily life of an analyst. This Award aims to:\nEncourage statistical software development by providing formal\nrecognition of these developments\nShowcase the pool of statistical software developers in our local\ncommunities and\nRaise awareness of the statistical tools developed by community\nmembers.\nThe use of open-source software (e.g. Python and R) is fast growing\namong users of programming languages, and such software is widely used\nfor statistical computing and graphics. This Award focuses on\nopen-source software because the methods are transparent to users, and\nmany of the contributions are volunteered by the community with little\nremuneration or formal recognition. This is a factor which this Award\naims to address.\n Professor\nDianne Cook\n\nProfessor Dianne Cook was born and raised in regional Australia. She\ncompleted her Bachelor of Science at the University of New England\nbefore heading to the USA to complete her PhD in Statistics at Rutgers\nUniversity. Prof. Cook spent most of her academic career at the\nDepartment of Statistics at the Iowa State University before returning\nback to Australia in 2015 to join the Department of Econometrics and\nBusiness Statistics at Monash University. She is particularly well known\nfor her research in visual inference and high-dimensional data\nvisualisation and as an avid advocate of statistical software\ndevelopment. A number of students under her supervision have developed\nhighly successful R packages, including Hadley Wickham who developed\nggplot2, Yihui Xie who developed knitr and\nEaro Wang who developed tsibble.\n Contact\nIf you have any enquiries about this award, please get in touch by\nemailing vic.branch@statsoc.org.au.\n\n\n\n",

Up to 400 words.\nAn installable software product (e.g. package or web app) with its source code for use by the judging panel. It should be accompanied by enough information to allow the judges to effectively use and evaluate the software (including its design considerations). This information can be provided in a variety of ways, including but not limited to: a user manual, a manuscript, a website, or an online help resource for the package.\nFor team developers, a letter endorsing that the majority of the software development was done by the student(s).\nThe applicant may also optionally submit:\nAny evidence of potential impact and usefulness to the community.\nAny accepted paper(s) related to the software.\nA written tutorial demonstrating the use of the software product with a limit of 4000 words that can be shared on this website.\nAll of these items should be submitted by completing the application form under Forms before the application deadline. All submitted materials must be in English.\nJudges & Assessors\nAssessors will be drawn from expert statistical software developers who are not entrants in the current round.\nAssessors will be preferably drawn from outside of Victoria and Tasmania.\nAssessors give input by completing the assessor form similar to the one supplied under Forms.\nThe judging panel will comprise committee members of the Statistical Computing and Visualisation Section of the Statistical Society of Australia or other members selected by the SSA Vic & Tas council.\nAssessors for this competition will be decided after close of submission upon consultation with the judging panel.\nA judging panel will collate assessors input to decide on the winner.\nThe decision of the judging panel is final.\nIf you would like to be an assessor, please email vic.branch@statsoc.org.au along with your software expertise.\nForms\n\nApplication form\n\n\nAssessor form\n\n Important Dates\n\nDate\nWhat\nMon 2nd Oct 2023\nOpening of submissions\nFri 24th Nov 2023 Fri 8th Dec 2023\nClose of submissions\nMarch 2024 meeting\nAnnouncement of the award winner\n\n Prize\nThe awardee will receive a cash prize of $1,000 and an opportunity to present their work at an event planned in 2024.\nAll applications of sufficient quality will have their tutorial (if supplied) made available on the website (https://statsocaus.github.io/dicook-award/) with its introduction and link to the tutorial circulated to SSA Vic members and other avenues.\n\n\n\n",
