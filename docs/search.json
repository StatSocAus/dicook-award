This Award aims to:\nEncourage statistical software development by providing formal\nrecognition of these developments\nShowcase the pool of statistical software developers in our local\ncommunities and\nRaise awareness of the statistical tools developed by community\nmembers.\nThe use of open-source software (e.g. Python and R) is fast growing\namong users of programming languages, and such software is widely used\nfor statistical computing and graphics. This Award focuses on\nopen-source software because the methods are transparent to users, and\nmany of the contributions are volunteered by the community with little\nremuneration or formal recognition. This is a factor which this Award\naims to address.\n Professor\nDianne Cook\n\nProfessor Dianne Cook was born and raised in regional Australia. She\ncompleted her Bachelor of Science at the University of New England\nbefore heading to the USA to complete her PhD in Statistics at Rutgers\nUniversity. Prof. Cook spent most of her academic career at the\nDepartment of Statistics at the Iowa State University before returning\nback to Australia in 2015 to join the Department of Econometrics and\nBusiness Statistics at Monash University. She is particularly well known\nfor her research in visual inference and high-dimensional data\nvisualisation and as an avid advocate of statistical software\ndevelopment. A number of students under her supervision have developed\nhighly successful R packages, including Hadley Wickham who developed\nggplot2, Yihui Xie who developed knitr and\nEaro Wang who developed tsibble.\n Contact\nIf you have any enquiries about this award, please get in touch by\nemailing vic.branch@statsoc.org.au.\n\n\n\n",
