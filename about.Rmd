Statistical software tools make a considerable difference to the daily life of an analyst. This Award aims to: 

1. Encourage statistical software development by providing formal recognition of these developments
2. Showcase the pool of statistical software developers in our local communities and
3. Raise awareness of the statistical tools developed by community members. 

The use of open-source software (e.g. Python and R) is fast growing among users of programming languages, and such software is widely used for statistical computing and graphics. This Award focuses on open-source software because the methods are transparent to users, and many of the contributions are volunteered by the community with little remuneration or formal recognition. This is a factor which this Award aims to address.
